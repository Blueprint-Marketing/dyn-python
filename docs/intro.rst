Introduction

Philosophy
----------

While version 0.1 of the Dyn API Wrapper was a fantastic tool, users were
required to build their own libraries around it, which is a pretty cumbersome
task. In order to reduce these difficulties we have taken a new approach to the
API wrapper, a completely Object Oriented approach. This new library encompasses
all of the functionality provided by both the Dyn Traffic Management and Message
Management APIs. For more additional documentation on the Dyn APIs please see
the Dyn API `Rest Resources <https://help.dynect.net/rest-resources/>`_ page.
