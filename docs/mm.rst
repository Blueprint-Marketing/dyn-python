dyn.mm (Message Management) Module
==================================
The dyn.mm (MM) module provides access to all of the Message Management
resources provided by
`Dyn's Message Management REST API <https://help.dynect.net/api/>`_.
It's important to note that all code examples assume the existence of a
:class:`~dyn.mm.session.MMSession` instance. This object is used by the
modules described below to access the API and make their associated calls.
